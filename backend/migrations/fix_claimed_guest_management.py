Database migration: Fix management relationships for claimed guests
-------------------------------------------------------------------
When guests with management relationships claimed their accounts,
the management relationship wasn't transferred to the new group_member record.
This migration fixes that by looking at claimed guests and updating their
corresponding group_member records.

Usage:
    python migrations/fix_claimed_guest_management.py [--dry-run] [--db-path <path>]

Options:
    --dry-run       Show what would be done without making changes
    --db-path       Path to SQLite database (default: db.sqlite3)
